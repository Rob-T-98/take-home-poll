# Atomjuice Take Home Poll
The Atomjuice Take Home Poll application is a standard Django application created using the Django admin tool, 
see [here](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for more information on how to get the project started.

## Project Overview
The project is an incomplete short mock programmer survey that is intended to act similarly to a Google Form, which 
asks a few questions and should save the responses to be displayed on a subsequent page.

## Project Brief
As a user of the application I want to collect the answers from the participants so that I can assess them independently.

As a participant I need to be able to submit my answers and view the current results of the entire survey on a 
subsequent page, similar to the results page of [strawpoll](https://www.strawpoll.me/).

If you have any ideas to expand upon the brief, please feel free to implement them, but please also make sure you meet
the brief first.

## Additional Notes
We have provided the questions for you already in a skeleton template located in the take_home_poll/templates/index.html
file.

We expect that completing the outstanding work for this project should take roughly 3 hours, this is not a hard limit
and is just a rough guideline. However the deadline will be a week from when you are provided with the take home 
assessment to ensure that you are given enough time despite any other potential commitments.

We will be looking for a good understanding of the problem and a reasonable solution. We will be assessing the quality
of the code submitted ensuring that it is easy to read, understand, maintain and would be ready for a production 
environment.

Please reach out if you have any clarification questions.
